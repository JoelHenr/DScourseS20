\section{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This data was pulled from Wikipedia, and it is about the winners of the "Ballon d'Or" award. This award is equivalent to the MBA MVP award but for soccer. The data is interesting to me, because I am Portuguese and biased towards Cristiano Ronaldo due to this fact. As far as utility for the future, the data probably not so much. However, the ability to practice website scraping, ABSOLUTELY! I did not use any additional websites to help accomplish this portion of the assignment. I stuck to the methods we used in class. 
    \item So, I went to your friend's (Dr. Huntington-Klein) website to download the packages related to financial markets. Then, I went over to this website (https://towardsdatascience.com/best-5-free-stock-market-apis-in-2019-ad91dddec984) and followed the tutorial in python for using Yahoo Finances API. After, doing this I compared the results to each other. I work in private equity, however, I like to apply these skills to the public markets. Thus, it is very helpful to be able to access this data in real time and using it to see if it fits my requirements.
